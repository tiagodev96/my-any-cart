# 🛒 My Any Cart

**My Any Cart** is a personal project designed to make tracking and managing your shopping easy, fast, and organized.
Built with **Next.js** for the frontend, it allows you to **add, edit, and remove products**, set quantities and prices, and see the **total cost** in real time — before you even get to the checkout.

This repository contains the **frontend application**. The backend (in development) will be powered by **Django REST Framework** with **PostgreSQL**.
